        "\n# Speeding up PARAFAC2 with SVD compression\n\nPARAFAC2 can be very time-consuming to fit. However, if the number of rows greatly\nexceeds the number of columns or the data matrices are approximately low-rank, we can\ncompress the data before fitting the PARAFAC2 model to considerably speed up the fitting\nprocedure.\n\nThe compression works by first computing the SVD of the tensor slices and fitting the\nPARAFAC2 model to the right singular vectors multiplied by the singular values. Then,\nafter we fit the model, we left-multiply the $B_i$-matrices with the left singular\nvectors to recover the decompressed model. Fitting to compressed data and then\ndecompressing is mathematically equivalent to fitting to the original uncompressed data.\n\nFor more information about why this works, see the documentation of\n:py:meth:`tensorly.decomposition.preprocessing.svd_compress_tensor_slices`.\n"
