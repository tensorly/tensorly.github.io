        "Here we will load a tensor of experimentally measured cellular responses to \nIL-2 stimulation. IL-2 is a naturally occurring immune signaling molecule \nwhich has been engineered by pharmaceutical companies and drug designers \nin attempts to act as an effective immunotherapy. In order to make effective IL-2\ntherapies, pharmaceutical engineer have altered IL-2's signaling activity in order to\nincrease or decrease its interactions with particular cell types. \n\nIL-2 signals through the Jak/STAT pathway and transmits a signal into immune cells by \nphosphorylating STAT5 (pSTAT5). When phosphorylated, STAT5 will cause various immune  \ncell types to proliferate, and depending on whether regulatory (regulatory T cells, or Tregs) \nor effector cells (helper T cells, natural killer cells, and cytotoxic T cells,\nor Thelpers, NKs, and CD8+ cells) respond, IL-2 signaling can result in \nimmunosuppression or immunostimulation respectively. Thus, when designing a drug\nmeant to repress the immune system, potentially for the treatment of autoimmune\ndiseases, IL-2 which primarily enacts a response in Tregs is desirable. Conversely,\nwhen designing a drug that is meant to stimulate the immune system, potentially for\nthe treatment of cancer, IL-2 which primarily enacts a response in effector cells\nis desirable. In order to achieve either signaling bias, IL-2 variants with altered\naffinity for it's various receptors (IL2R\u03b1 or IL2R\u03b2) have been designed. Furthermore\nIL-2 variants with multiple binding domains have been designed as multivalent \nIL-2 may act as a more effective therapeutic. In order to understand how these mutations\nand alterations affect which cells respond to an IL-2 mutant, we will perform \nnon-negative PARAFAC tensor decomposition on our cell response data tensor.\n\nHere, our data contains the responses of 8 different cell types to 13 different \nIL-2 mutants, at 4 different timepoints, at 12 standardized IL-2 concentrations.\nTherefore, our tensor will have shape (13 x 4 x 12 x 8), with dimensions\nrepresenting IL-2 mutant, stimulation time, dose, and cell type respectively. Each\nmeasured quantity represents the amount of phosphorlyated STAT5 (pSTAT5) in a \ngiven cell population following stimulation with the specified IL-2 mutant.\n\n"
